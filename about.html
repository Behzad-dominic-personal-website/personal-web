        I was born and raised in Pakistan, I came into the States in 2013, my family is from Afghanistan, 
        but my parents decided to move due to the war that was going on in Afghanistan,
        in search for a better living conditions as well as better education for me and my siblings,
        I am someone that is full of excitement when it comes to 
        new things. I enjoy learning new things that can be different culture beliefs as well as language.

        In my free time, I enjoy watching Anime, playing video games and
        sometimes I like to watch YouTube. I work to becomeing a coder/
        progammer one day due to the reason its my passion since I was a kid.
        The idea of being able to write a line of words to make a comptuer move
        a character in a video game function is fanscinating.

        <div class="Anime">
        <p> My favorite Anime currently has to be AOT (Attack on Titan) due to how rich the story based it is, from beginning to the very end, the tiny details
          when you first watch the show you wonder, "what does this all mean" or "why is this important" You become hooked to knowing more and 
          Each tiny detail you thought wasn't important was the author's way of making you feel dumb. I have many more animes I like to enjoy 
          anime like One Punch Man, Golden Kamuy, and many more.
