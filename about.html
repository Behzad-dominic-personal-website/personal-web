        In my free time, I enjoy watching Anime, playing video games and
        sometimes I like to watch YouTube. I work to becomeing a coder/
        progammer one day due to the reason its my passion since I was a kid.
        The idea of being able to write a line of words to make a comptuer move
        a character in a video game function is fanscinating.

        <div class="Anime">
        <p> My favorite Anime currently has to be AOT due to how rich the story based it is, from begining to the very end, the tiny deatils
          when you first watch the show you wonder, "what does this all mean" or "why is this important" You become hooked to knowing more and 
          each minior deatils you thought wasn't importat was the author way of making you feel dumb. I have many more animes I like to enjoy 
          anime like One Punch Man, Golden Kamuy, and many more.
